        <p class="lead">This is a short post about what the OSI model is.</p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>The Internet</b></p>
        <p>So, just before we start with the OSI model, what is the 'Internet'?
          The Internet is essentially a network of networks - a huge set of computers/systems connected together.
          You will most likely have a small network in your home or office. A router, connected to a computer or mobile device through WiFi. That is a network.
          On your street you may have a local connector built by an internet service provider, this connects all the networks in all of the houses together.
          That box then goes off to another larger connector. Now just imagine all of the houses and all of the connections that exist out there in the world. That is the internet.
          It provides a way for 'Bob' in Tokyo to send digital messages to 'Alice' in London.
          The <b>OSI model</b> is a way of splitting up how the Internet works into smaller 'layers' in order to make sense of it all. The Internet is fantastic thing, but it is very very complex.
        </p>

        <p><b>The OSI Model</b></p>
        <p>
          As mentioned before, the internet has been 'split' into layers to control the complexity.
          One way of doing this (there are a few others) is by using the OSI Model.
          What this means is that the Internet is slit into <b>7 layers</b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          These are:
          <ul>
            <li>Physical</li>
            <li>Data</li>
            <li>Network</li>
            <li>Transport</li>
            <li>Session</li>
            <li>Presentation</li>
            <li>Application</li>
          </ul>
          With each layer doing something very important to enable a message to get form A to B.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p><b>Physical Layer</b></p>
        This layer is to do with physical medium that data passes through. Some examples would be ethernet, bluetooth, GSM, DSL.
        Equipment that can provide a physcial layer service include Network interface cards (NIC), Modems and Ethernet hubs.
        <hr>
        <p>Data Layer</p>
        This layer is to do with transfering data from one node to another within a network.
        <hr>
        <p><b>Network Layer</b></p>
        This layer is to do with the forwarding of 'packets' from a host to a destination.
        Some of the protocols that operate on the network layer include IPv4/v6, ICMP and IPSec.
        <hr>
        <p>Transport Layer</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Session Layer</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Presentation Layer</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Application Layer</p>
        <hr>
