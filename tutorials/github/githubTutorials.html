        <p class="lead">This post contains a brief overview of Github and will include some essential Git commands.</p>
        <p>Github/Git is an incredibly useful tool for developers, but can be utilised by almost anyone.</p>
        <p>If you want to know more, search online - there's tons of great material.</p>
        <p>There are two parts to this tutorial, <a href="#gitCommandsContent">Commands</a> and <a href="#gitExampleContent">Creating a repo from an existing project</a>.

            <h5>Some userful Git commands:</h5>
            <p><b>git clone link_from_Github</b><br>
        This command is used for cloning a repository from Github to your local
        machine. The link is one copied from a repo, in the green box that says
        clone or download.<br>
        It's worth while mentioning now that there are actually a few ways of
        getting the code from the Github website to your local machine. These are:
              <ul>
                <li>Downloading the zip file. This is probably the easiest way, you
                  simply download a .zip from Github containing all the files in the
                  repository. It is however perhaps the least elegant way of utilising
                  Github's functionality.</li>
                <li>Cloning using HTTP. This simply uses the Hyper Text Transfer
                  Protocol to transfer the data from Github.com to your computer.</li>
                <li>Cloning using SSH. This uses the SSH protocol to transfer the data
                  to your local machine, you'll need to set up an SSH key to use this.
                  Tutorial on how to do so can be found here.(link to ssh tutorial)</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>git remote -v</b><br>
        This command tells you where the repository on your local machine will fetch (get updates) from and push (update the repo on Github) to.
        </p>
            <p>
              <b>git remote other stuff</b><br>
        This command is useful for stating where the code you're working on links to on Github
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>git pull</b><br>
        This command is used for getting the most up to date code from the repository on Github to your local machine.
        </p>
            <p>
              <b>git branch</b><br>
        This command shows you what branch you are working on and what other branches are on your local machine.
        </p>
            <p>
              <b>git branch nameOfBranch</b><br>
        This command switches to a new branch, it's good practice because you don't want to be making changes directly to the master.

        </p>
            <p>
              <b>git checkout -b nameOfBranch</b><br>
        This command checks out a the branch stated, it allows you to start working on a branch that is not the master.
        </p>
            <p>
              <b>git status</b><br>
        This command tells you what files have been modified,
        i.e. what files on your machine are different to the master branch.
        </p>
            <p>
              <b>git add .</b><br>
        This command adds all of the changes to files that have been made.
        You can be more specific by using: git add "nameOfFileYouWantToAdd"
        </p>
            <p>
              <b>git commit -m "Message to accompany the commit"</b><br>
        This command essentially prepares the work done to be pushed to the branch of your choice.
        You don't have to use the -m flag accompanied by the message wrapped in "", but it's a very good habit to have.
        It lets others (and yourself) know what changes were made, in a short concise sentence. It can save you from trawling through the code to find out.
        </p>
            <p>
              <b>git reset --hard HEAD^</b><br>
        This command removes the commit you've just made.
        </p>
            <p>
              <b>git reset --hard HEAD~x</b><br>
        Where x is the number of commits you want to remove (integer, i.e. 2, 3, 4 etc.)
        </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
              <b>Example</b><br>
        This is a quick example of how I use some of these git commands when working on a repository with colleagues.<br>
        Start by getting the repo onto my own machine:<br>
         - git clone "repo link from Github"<br>
        Now the code is on my machine.<br>
         - git branch TESTBRANCH<br>
        Make some changes to the code. Check which files need to be committed/pushed.<br>
         - git status<br>
         - git add .<br>
         - git commit -m "Brief explanation of what has been added"<br>
         - git push -u origin TESTBRANCH<br>
         Now the code is pushed to Github, you can raise a pull request which is the chance for someone else to double check your changes, if they are happy they can merge it. This combines your code with the master branch.

            <h5>Creating a Git repo from an existing project:</h5>
            <p>An example of setting up a Github repo from an existing project on Linux/Mac using the terminal.</p>
            <p>Prerequisites:
              <ul>
                <li>set up a Github account</li>
                <li>have Github enabled on your device</li>
                <li>have a project</li>
              </ul>
              If you already have a project you want to put onto Github that's great, but for this example I'll make one quickly.
              <pre><code>
              cd ~/Desktop && mkdir testRepo && touch testRepo/helloWorld.txt
            </code></pre>
              I've just moved to my Desktop, created a directory called testRepo and it contains a text file called 'helloWorld.txt'
              Now, you'll want to go to www.Github.com and login. At the top right there are two icons, one for your profile and one with a + symbol. Click the + symbol and select 'New repository'.
              Give the repository a name, anything you like. I'll call mine testRepo. A description is optional so we'll leave that blank for now. Leave everything else as it is and click 'Create repository'.
              Now, head to your command line move into the top level of our project, initialise it as a git repo and set the upstream to your newly created repo on Github:
              <pre><code>
              cd ~/Desktop/testRepo
              git init
              git remote add origin https://github.com/$githubUserName/$gitHubRepoName.git
              git add .
              git commit -m "Initial commit"
              git push -u origin master
            </code></pre>
              Now if you check the repo on Github, the helloWorld.txt file will be in your repo.
            </p>
